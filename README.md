# Pathfinding Visualizer

This pathinding visualization is built with NextJS, React and TailwindCSS.

## How To

Click on a grid tile to turn it into a wall or a walkable path.
Choose from BFS, DFS, Dijkstra and A* as options for path finding algorithms.
Calculate the algorithm steps and run the animation!

## Why

This is a toy project to explore more React development.
